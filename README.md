# SwiftCoreAudio
Swift versions of the examples from "Learning Core Audio" (Adamson &amp; Avila)

As I work my way through the excellent book "Learning Core Audio" by Chris Adamson and Kevin Avila I'm running the example code in it's original Objective-C / C form and then converting each example to run in XCode 8 (beta) using Swift 3.


NOTE: CH08_AUGraphInput compiles with errors. I haven't worked out (yet) how to access the C++ CARingBuffer from Swift.
